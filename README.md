Heroku Deployment: [https://carbe-diem.herokuapp.com/](https://carbe-diem.herokuapp.com/)

## Features
- Track Calories
- Quickly Add Food from our database
- Track Macro Nutrients
- Calculate Total Daily Energy Expenditure
- Calculate Body Mass Index and other health indicators



## User Flow
Very simple user flow. All you have to do is sign up and calculate your initial health stats. Once that is taken care of you are able to either add foods to your daily entries or to search foods that currently do not exist in the database. Foods that have been previously searched before do not make additional api calls so as more users sign up and foods become more diverse the database grows and limits API calls to help save on cost.
